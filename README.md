# BPost-client

BPost is a Messaging App implemented for the project of the Communication Networks and Protocols course from Prof. Dricot.

# Execute
To launch the client part of the project, first launch the server (cf. BPost-server repository : https://github.com/AFlachs/BPost-server)

To open a client session, execute the file src/main.py with a Python Virtual Environment. 

All modules used in the App are listed in the requirements.txt document.

# Cryptography 
This messaging app crypts the messages between two clients by using symmetric cryptography based on a common key given by the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
